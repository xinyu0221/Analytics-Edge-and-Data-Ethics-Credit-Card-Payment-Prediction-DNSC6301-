## Quantitative Analysis
- **Metrics used to evaluate the final model**:
  - Confusion metrics
  - AUC & AIR graphs：
    AIR is an adverse impact ratio, calculates the adverse impact ratio as a quotient between protected and reference group acceptance rates.
- **The final values of the metrics for all data**:
  - Training AUC: 0.78
  - Validation AUC: 0.75
  - Test AUC: 0.74
  - Asian-to-White AIR: 1.00
  - Black-to-White AIR: 0.85
  - Female-to-Male AIR: 1.02
  - Hispanic-to-White AIR: 0.83

- **Correlation Heatmap**

![Heat_Map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111463982/186793614-00bc10ba-5c20-4e33-bfe9-9498a22079f7.png)

  - The table shows how two variables are correlated with each other using Pearson correlation matrix, the light part shows the strong correlation is -1.
  - According to the heat map, we can see race the outcome are negatively correlated, indicating that there might be discrimination towards certian groups of people. We can also see that payment records are among the most influencial factors of the result. a lot of other factors contributes very little towards the result.

- **Histogram**

  - These are histograms, and it shows that most of the data is skewed in nature.
  - Female has higher credit limits than male, while White and Asian customers has higher credit limit than hispanic and black customers. 

- **Final Iteration Plot**

  -  As we can see from the plot, AUC of training data continous to improve as the tree depth increases, while the AUC of validation data peaks at tree depth = 6. For the AIR of hispanic-to-white people, and we got an good result at tree depth = [5:7]. As a result, we think tree depth = 6 is the best choice. 

## Ethical Considerations

- **Describe potential negative impacts of using your model**:
  - **Math or software problems**: The data has an artificially high proportion of 1s (defaults), typically we would expect less than 1% 1s (default) in a credit default problem. 
  - **Real-world risks: who, what, when, or how**: The values of the adverse impact ratio for Black & Hispanic people might cause civil rights or gender equity controversy. When the model is used to increase people's credit limits, Black & Hispanic people receive fewer credit increases than similarly situated White people. The model might cause unacceptable legal or reputational risk.
- **Describe potential uncertainties relating to the impacts of using your model**:
  - **Math or software problems**: Implicit bias may exist in the model and data.
  - **Real-world risks: who, what, when, or how**: The model may be exposed to well-known risks such as DDOS or man-in-the-middle attacks, and packages it depends on could potentially be hacked to conceal an attack payload.
- **Describe any unexpected results**:
  - When running this model, even with the same SEED, the results change slightly every time. Also, the model might cause unacceptable reputational risk.
